# pegasus-JB-PoC
Pegasus exploit port to iOS from 2016

My (hacked up) version of the exploit from 2016 to dump the kernel from memory using the Pegasus UAF. 
Siguza [finished](https://github.com/Siguza/cl0ver) a full exploit and released a great [writeup](https://siguza.github.io/cl0ver/) way before i could finish at that time. Thnx to him for all the discussions during the process of working on this.
