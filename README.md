# pegasus-JB-PoC
Pegasus exploit port to iOS from 2016

My version of the exploit from back then to dump the kernel using the pegasus/trident vulnerabilities. 
Siguza [finished](https://github.com/Siguza/cl0ver) a full-er exploit and released a great [writeup](https://siguza.github.io/cl0ver/) way before i could finish at that time. Thnx to him for all the discussions during the process of working on this.
